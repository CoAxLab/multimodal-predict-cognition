List Sorting is a measure of working memory, tapping both information processing and storage. It is considered a “fluid ability” measure, with performance tending to peak in early adulthood and then declining across the life span. Higher scores on each of these indicate higher levels of working memory. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.\n",

One can interpret the Fluid Cognition Composite as a more global assessment of individual and group fluid cognition functioning. Higher scores indicate higher levels of functioning. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average.\n",
